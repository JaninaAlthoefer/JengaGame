# JengaGame
A digital implementation of the game Jenga. Written in C++ and using NVidia PhysX (physics engine) and DirectX. 

The game is a digital adaptation of the Jenga Tower game. It uses the NVidia Physx engine to simulate each Jenga block and its physics properties.

Additionally, DirectX is used to visualise the 3D environment and play sounds.

A simple AI player has been implemented, enabling either 2Player Hotseat Play or Single Against AI playstyles.
